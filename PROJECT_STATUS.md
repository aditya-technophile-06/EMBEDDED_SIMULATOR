## 🔥 **INTERVIEW PREPARATION**

### **Key Talking Points**
When asked about embedded systems experience, you can say:

*"I built a comprehensive embedded systems simulator that demonstrates all the core concepts used in professional embedded development. The project includes a virtual SDK with peripherals like LEDs, buttons, sensors, and UART, each implementing real embedded features like GPIO control, interrupt handling, ADC conversion, and serial communication. I also created a Linux device driver simulation that handles device registration and file operations, plus an RTOS scheduler with priority-based task management and deadline monitoring."*

### **Technical Deep Dive**
Be prepared to walk through:
- **Device driver architecture** (`include/drivers/virtual_device.h`)
- **RTOS task management** (`include/rtos/task.h`)  
- **Hardware abstraction** (`include/sdk/led.h` as example)
- **Build system setup** (`Makefile` professional features)
