## What is an Embedded System?

### Simple Definition
An **embedded system** is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. Unlike a general-purpose computer (like your laptop), embedded systems are designed to do specific tasks.

### Real-World Examples
- **Microwave Oven**: Controls heating time, power level, display
- **Car Engine Control**: Manages fuel injection, ignition timing
- **Smart TV**: Handles video processing, user interface, network
- **Fitness Tracker**: Monitors heart rate, steps, sleep patterns
- **Router/WiFi**: Manages network traffic, security protocols

### Key Characteristics
1. **Real-Time Operation**: Must respond to inputs within strict time limits
2. **Resource Constrained**: Limited memory, CPU power, storage
3. **Dedicated Purpose**: Built for specific tasks, not general computing
4. **Reliability Critical**: Often cannot fail (car brakes, medical devices)
5. **24/7 Operation**: Run continuously without human intervention

## Project Overview

### What This Simulator Does
This project creates a **virtual embedded system** that demonstrates all the core concepts of embedded programming without requiring physical hardware.

### Why Create a Simulator?
1. **Learning**: Understand embedded concepts without expensive hardware
2. **Portfolio**: Demonstrate embedded skills to employers
3. **Testing**: Develop and test embedded software logic
4. **Education**: Show how embedded systems work internally

### What It Simulates
```

Interrupts             →    Callback functions
Hardware Registers     →    C++ class members
```

## Why Does It Run Continuously?

### The Nature of Embedded Systems
**Embedded systems NEVER stop running!** Think about:
- Your car's engine control runs as long as the car is on
- Your phone's operating system runs 24/7
- A router processes packets continuously
- Medical devices monitor patients constantly

### What You're Seeing
```
=== CONTINUOUS OPERATION ===
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Status LED: Heartbeat (1 Hz)   │  ← System alive indicator
│  Activity LED: Blinking (4 Hz)  │  ← Activity indicator  
│  Sensor Task: Reading (2 Hz)    │  ← Data collection
│  Monitor Task: Status (0.5 Hz)  │  ← System health check
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How to Control It
- **Stop**: Press `Ctrl+C` (graceful shutdown with statistics)
- **Emergency Stop**: Simulate long button press (>3 seconds)
- **Monitor**: System prints status every 20 seconds

---

## Key Embedded Systems Concepts

### 1. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
**What**: Scheduler that ensures tasks meet timing deadlines
**Why**: Critical tasks must execute on time (engine control, braking)

**In Our Project**:
```cpp
// High priority task - must run every 1 second
Task heartbeat("heartbeat", Task::Priority::HIGH, 
    []() { status_led->toggle(); },  // What to do
    Task::TaskType::PERIODIC,        // When to do it
    {std::chrono::milliseconds(1000), // Period: 1000ms
     std::chrono::milliseconds(50)}   // Deadline: 50ms
);
```

### 2. Interrupts
**What**: Hardware signals that interrupt normal program flow
**Why**: Immediate response to critical events (emergency stop, data ready)

**In Our Project**:
```cpp
// Button interrupt handler
user_button->enableInterrupt(Button::EdgeType::FALLING, 
    [](Button::State state, std::chrono::milliseconds duration) {
        if (duration.count() > 3000) {
            emergency_stop = true;  // Emergency stop on long press
        }
    });
```

### 3. Device Drivers
**What**: Software that controls hardware devices
**Why**: Provides standard interface to hardware (like /dev/led0)

**In Our Project**:
```cpp
// Register device with driver
device_driver->registerDevice("status_led", DeviceType::LED_DEVICE);
// Open device file (like /dev/status_led)
int fd = device_driver->openDevice("status_led");
```

### 4. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
**What**: Software layer that hides hardware-specific details
**Why**: Makes code portable across different hardware platforms

**In Our Project**:
```cpp
// Same interface for all LEDs, regardless of "hardware"
LED status_led("status_led");
status_led.turnOn();           // Works the same way
status_led.setBrightness(75);  // regardless of underlying hardware
```

### 5. Peripheral Control
**What**: Managing external devices (sensors, displays, motors)
**Why**: Embedded systems interact with the physical world

**In Our Project**:
```cpp
// Temperature sensor with filtering and alerts
temperature_sensor->setSamplingRate(5);  // 5 Hz sampling
temperature_sensor->setFilter(Sensor::FilterType::MOVING_AVERAGE, 10);
temperature_sensor->setThresholds(-10.0f, 50.0f);  // Alert limits
```

### 6. Memory Management
**What**: Efficient use of limited RAM and storage
**Why**: Embedded systems have strict memory constraints

**In Our Project**:
- Circular buffers for sensor data
- Fixed-size FIFOs for UART communication
- Pre-allocated task stacks

## Interview Preparation

### Essential Embedded Systems Questions

#### 1. **"What is an embedded system?"**
**Answer**: "An embedded system is a specialized computer system designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger system. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are optimized for specific tasks and often operate under real-time constraints with limited resources."

#### 2. **"Explain Real-Time Systems"**
**Answer**: "Real-time systems must respond to inputs within guaranteed time constraints. There are two types:
- **Hard Real-Time**: Missing a deadline causes system failure (car braking system)
- **Soft Real-Time**: Missing deadlines degrades performance but doesn't cause failure (video streaming)"

#### 3. **"What is an RTOS and why use it?"**
**Answer**: "An RTOS is a Real-Time Operating System that provides deterministic task scheduling. Unlike general-purpose OS, RTOS guarantees task execution within specific time bounds. It's essential for systems where timing is critical."

#### 4. **"Explain interrupt handling"**
**Answer**: "Interrupts are signals that temporarily halt normal program execution to handle urgent events. They provide immediate response to critical inputs like emergency stops or data-ready signals from peripherals."

#### 5. **"What are device drivers?"**
**Answer**: "Device drivers are software modules that provide a standard interface to hardware devices. They abstract hardware-specific details and provide uniform APIs for applications to interact with peripherals."

#### 6. **"How do you debug embedded systems?"**
**Answer**: 
- **JTAG/SWD debuggers**: Hardware-level debugging
- **Printf debugging**: Serial output for diagnostics  
- **LED indicators**: Visual status indication
- **Oscilloscope/Logic Analyzer**: Signal analysis
- **Static analysis tools**: Code quality checks"

#### 7. **"Explain memory management in embedded systems"**
**Answer**: "Embedded systems have limited memory, requiring efficient management:
- **Static allocation**: Predictable memory usage
- **Stack management**: Monitor stack overflow
- **Circular buffers**: Efficient data handling
